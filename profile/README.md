**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

We are a group of open-source enthusiasts who are passionate about cloud-native message queues. We have witnessed and tackled the challenges of message queue infrastructure in large internet and cloud computing companies. Now we hope to explore with the broad developer community, based on cloud-native technology, to reshape this key area and explore more possibilities of cloud-native message queues.

Recently, we open-sourced two cloud-native projects: AutoMQ for Kafka and AutoMQ for RocketMQ.
* [AutoMQ Kafka](https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq-for-kafka): A cloud native implementation for Apache Kafka, reducing your cloud infrastructure bill by up to 90%.
* [AutoMQ RocketMQ](https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq-for-rocketmq): A cloud native implementation for Apache RocketMQ 5.0.

There are some awesome technical advantages of our cloud-native solution:
* üçø 100% protocol compatible with Apache Kafka and RocketMQ.
* üåà Supports minute-level elasticity, built-in elasticity, and continuous traffic rebalancing components.
* üöÄ Second-level partition migration without data duplication.
* üßô Stateless Broker, offloading data to S3, enabling computation using Spot instances.
