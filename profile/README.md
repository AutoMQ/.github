We are a group of open-source enthusiasts who are passionate about cloud-native message queues. We have witnessed and tackled the challenges of message queue infrastructure in large internet and cloud computing companies. Now we hope to explore with the broad developer community, based on cloud-native technology, to reshape this key area and explore more possibilities of cloud-native message queues.

Our core product, [AutoMQ](https://github.com/AutoMQ/automq/), is a stateless Kafka alternative that operates on S3 or any S3-compatible storage like MinIO. It addresses two main issues with Apache Kafka: the difficulty of scaling Kafka clusters due to the stateful nature of its brokers, which requires complex data movement and partition reassignment, and the high costs of hosting Kafka in the cloud, including expensive EBS storage, cross-AZ traffic, and significant over-provisioning due to limited scalability.

There are some awesome technical advantages of our cloud-native solution:
* üçø 100% protocol compatible with Apache Kafka.
* üåà Supports minute-level elasticity, built-in elasticity, and continuous traffic rebalancing components.
* üöÄ Second-level partition migration without data duplication.
* üßô Stateless Broker, offloading data to S3, enabling computation using Spot instances. 

Welcome to join our technical discussion group, where you can exchange experiences with tech experts, share insights, and collectively explore the forefront of technology.
